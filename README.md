# About this assignment
This assignment was given in the class DevOps, taken in the fourth semester of Software Engineering at UiA Grimstad, Norway. The report was written as the assignment submission (and assumes that the reader knows what the task is). The task description is also provided in this repository.

## Reflections
Having four compose files seems inefficient. However, this structure was chosen so that the student could understand what each container was doing, and how they contributed to the bigger picture. This assignment focussed on deployment, so the website was copied directly as indicated by the task description. Altogether, this was a fun and useful task.

A better strategey would be to publish the app image as a Docker image, and then pull that image to the server running the application.
